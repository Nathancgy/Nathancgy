> _Heya_

I'm currently working on ML research at [Kimi](https://www.kimi.com/) (prev at [Tilde](https://tilderesearch.com/))

I’m interested in efficient attention, or hardware-aligned ML algorithms in general.

I occasionally participate in competitive programming competitions.

It's nice meeting you! Feel free to reach chengy0115@gmail.com
